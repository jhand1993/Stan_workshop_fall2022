# PITT 2022 Stan Workshop
## Getting started
If you want to use the conda environment I use, from the repository's base directory run the following in your terminal:
>conda env create -f environment.yml.

PyStan is compatible with macOS and some Linux distribution, so make sure your computer is compatible before embarking on this workshop.

Note: we are using PyStan 3, which is a significant rewrite of PyStan and is not compatible with PyStan 2.  Make sure to install PyStan via pip to get the latest stable PyStan 3!

## Workshop 1
This notebook introduces Stan and its python wrapper PyStan 3.  Learn basic syntax and how to run some linear regression models!
